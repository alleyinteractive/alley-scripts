Block editor tools supercharges your block editor experience, Alley style.

## Description ##

The Block Editor Tools plugin by [Alley Interactive](https://alley.co) is an experimental project to consolidate an common blocks and editorial tools built by Alley into a single installable plugin that can be included in any project to speed up delivery of common features.

A secondary objective of this project, is to create a laboratory where we can iteratively build functionality for the block editor that we can publish as discrete `npm` packages that can be used to speed up development of custom block editor interfaces.
