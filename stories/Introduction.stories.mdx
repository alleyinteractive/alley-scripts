# Introduction

Alley Scripts is an experimental project of
[Alley Interactive](https://alley.com/) and serves as a laboratory where we can
iteratively build and publish functionality as discrete `npm` packages that can
be used in projects to speed up development.

On this site, you can find documentation for each package, as well as
interactive components for each package that can be used to test out the
functionality.

## Packages

The following packages are currently available:

### `@alleyinteractive/block-editor-tools`

This package contains a set of modules to aid in building features for the
WordPress block editor.
