# Scaffolder

This action aids to quickly scaffold templates for a project. Any project can
define templates that can be used to quickly scaffold a set of files with
pre-defined values.

## Usage

Run the package with `npx`:

```sh
npx @alleyinteractive/scaffolder@latest
```

The following arguments are available:

```
  --dry-run            Run the command without making any changes.
  -h, --help           Prints help information.
```

If the command is not run from the root of a plugin, you can either pass the
`--path` argument or the command will prompt you for the path to the plugin to
release.
