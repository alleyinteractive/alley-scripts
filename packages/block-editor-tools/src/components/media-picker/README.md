# MediaPicker

Allows for a simple media upload/replace/remove feature for media for blocks.

## Usage

``` js
<MediaPicker
  allowedTypes={['application/pdf']}
  className="media-picker"
  onReset={() => setAttributes({ mediaId: 0 })}
  onUpdate={({ id }) => setAttributes({ mediaId: id })}
  value={mediaId}
/>
```

The value of `mediaId` is the ID of the media element, and is destructured from
`props.attributes`.

There are additional options for the MediaPicker that can be configured via the
props listed below. For example, the MediaPicker also supports URL entry as well
as custom preview components, which is useful when you want to render an image
or an embed instead of just a text link to the selected asset.
