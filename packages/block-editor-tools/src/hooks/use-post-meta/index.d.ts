/**
 * A custom React hook that wraps useEntityProp for working with postmeta. This
 * hook is intended to reduce boilerplate code in components that need to read
 * and write postmeta. By default, it operates on postmeta for the current post,
 * but you can optionally pass a post type and post ID in order to get and set
 * post meta for an arbitrary post.
 * @param {string} postType - Optional. The post type to get and set meta for.
 *                            Defaults to the post type of the current post.
 * @param {number} postId - Optional. The post ID to get and set meta for.
 *                          Defaults to the ID of the current post.
 * @returns {array} An array containing an object representing postmeta and an update function.
